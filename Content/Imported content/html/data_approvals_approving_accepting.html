            <p>DHIS2 supports two different types of approval processes: either a one-step process where
 the data is approved at each level, or a two-step process where data is first approved and
 then accepted at each level. This is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
            <div class="figure">
                <a name="d0e19874">
                </a>
                <p class="title">
                    <b>Figure&#160;17.2.&#160;Approving and accepting</b>
                </p>
                <div class="figure-contents">
                    <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
                        <table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0;cellspacing: 0;" width="300">
                            <tr>
                                <td align="center">
                                    <img src="../Resources/approval_level_steps.png" align="middle" width="300" alt="Approving and accepting" />
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br class="figure-break" />
            <p>In the one-step process, data is approved at one level, and then approved at the next
 higher level. Until it is approved at the next higher level, it may be unapproved at the first
 level. (For example, if the data was approved my mistake, this allows the approver to undo
 their mistake.) Once the data is approved at the next higher level, it may not be unapproved
 at the lower level unless it is first unapproved at the higher level. </p>
            <p>In the two-step process, data is approved at one level, and then the approval is accepted
 at the same level. This acceptance is done by a user who is authorized to approve data at the
 next higher level. Once the data is accepted, it may not be changed or unapproved unless it is
 first <span class="italic">unaccepted</span>.</p>
            <p>The two-step process is not required by DHIS2. It is an optional step for a user reviewing
 data at the next higher level. It has the benefit of locking the acceptance from the level
 below, so reviewer does not have to worry that the data could be changing from below while it
 is being reviewed. It can also be used by the higher-level user to keep track of which
 lower-level data has already been reviewed.</p>
