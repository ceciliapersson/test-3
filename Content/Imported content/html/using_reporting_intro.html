            <p>The reporting module in DHIS2 provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section
 will explain how to use them to view and analyse data. Another section explains how to
 configure and set up the various reporting tools.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>Standard reports:</strong>
                </span> Standard reports are built on pivot
 tables, but are more advanced in its design allowing for more cosmetics and styles. These
 reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available
 as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF files
 which makes them ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>Dataset reports:</strong>
                </span> Dataset reports are simply a printer
 friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either raw or aggregated data (over time or
 place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports. This will
 work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>Dashboard:</strong>
                </span> The fastest way to view your data. The
 dashboard can display up to four updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favourite
 reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>Data Visualizer:</strong>
                </span> Do flexible visualizations of your data
 as charts and data tables. Any number of indicators and data elements can be included. Several
 chart types are available, such as column, stacked column, line, area and pie charts. The
 charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal
 dashboard. Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer. </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>Orgunit distribution reports:</strong>
                </span> These reports are generated
 off the orgunit group set information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of
 health facilities that are located in a given area (any level in the hierarchy). These reports
 are automatically generated and display the information in both tables and charts, and
 downloads in PDF, excel, and CSV are available.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>Reporting rate summary:</strong>
                </span> These reports provide a nice
 overview of how many facilities that have submitted their data for a given dataset and period.
 Here you can get both the counts and the percentages showing the reporting rate for all or
 single data sets.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>Web-based pivot tables:</strong>
                </span> The built in pivot table tool is
 a web-based tool to display indicator data by orgunit and period in a typical pivot table view
 and allows for pivoting manipulations of the tables. It allows for large amounts of data to be
 downloaded offline for analysis as well. </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">
                    <strong>GIS:</strong>
                </span> Present and analyse your data using thematic maps.
 You can view both data elements and indicators and given that you have coordinates for all
 your orgunits you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country
 polygons to facility points. See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map
 information is built into DHIS2 and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your
 organisation units and the maps will be available.</p>
