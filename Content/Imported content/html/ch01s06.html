            <p>Software carries the instructions that tell a computer how to
 operate. The human authored and human readable form of those
 instructions is called source code. Before the computer can actually
 execute the instructions, the source code must be translated into a
 machine readable (binary) format, called the object code. All
 distributed software includes the object code, but <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> makes the
 source code available as well.</p>
            <p>Proprietary software owners license their copyrighted object
 code to a user, which allows the user to run the program. <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr>
        programs, on the other hand, license both the object and the source
 code, permitting the user to run, modify and possibly redistribute the
 programs. With access to the source code, the users have the freedom
 to run the program for any purpose, redistribute, probe, adapt, learn
 from, customise the software to suit their needs, and release
 improvements to the public for the good of the community. Hence, some
        <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> is also known as free software, where “free” refers, first and
 foremost, to the above freedoms rather than in the monetary sense of
 the word.</p>
            <p>Within the public health sector, <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> can potentially have a
 range of benefits, including:</p>

                    <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Lower costs as it does not involve paying for prohibitive
 license costs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Given the information needs for the health sector are
 constantly changing and evolving, there is a need for the user to
 have the freedom to make the changes as per the user requirements.
 This is often limited in proprietary systems.</p>

                    <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Access to source code to enable integration and interoperability. In the health sector interoperability between different software applications is becoming increasingly important, meaning enabling two or more systems to communicate metadata and data. This work is a lot easier, and sometimes dependent on the source code being available to the developers that create the integration. This availability is often not possible
 in the case of proprietary software. And when it is, it comes at a
 high cost and contractual obligations.</p>

                        <p>FOSS applications like DHIS2 typically are supported by a
 global network of developers, and thus have access to cutting edge
 research and development knowledge.</p>
